# lyric-master

A Clojure application designed to help songwriters improve their lyrics through data analysis of successful songs:

### Prerequisites

- Java 12.0.1
- Leiningen 2.8.1

## Usage

Original design is for hip hop lyric analysis

### Metrics

Planned initial features
- matching rhymes
- counting bars
- counting word frequencies

### Parsing text files

Parses songs from `.txt` files in `/resources` folder which is found at project root.

Songs are parsed with the following rules:

- `NEW SONG starts a new song
- Optional domain specific commands exist to define certain parameters.
    - usage: `COMMAND "parameter"`
    - E.g. `TITLE "title"` sets title. `"title"` must be inside quotes.
    - Available commands: `ARTIST, TITLE`
- Words within brackets `()` & `[]` are ignored (background noise or info).
- Each new line starts a new bar. 
    - A bar means roughly "one line in a poem (or song)"


example.txt

TITLE "My Name Is"
ARTIST "Eminem"

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)  

(...)


NEW SONG 

TITLE "Guilty Conscience"
         
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
