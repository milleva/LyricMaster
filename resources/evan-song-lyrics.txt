Im an exorcist, blatant
Like a nested switch statement
Next to this mathafucka
Driving a Lexus six
Never mind what we ride
reaktor Tesla, bitch
Within the best of cliques
I’ll be the head of chief,
with a piece of shredded cheese

NEW SONG

When I danger its funny
Cause if you ask permission
our mathematician will serve
any stranger with money

Despite the fight I put up
I light a match stick
Cause you might be bat shit crazy
Match this to yo rhymes
Cause you won’t even latch to a guy…. Who can code
And that’s my mind,
You better read it like a documented sing
I’ll lock you in a ride and start drivin
Down the road they call 5675 and
That was just a. Random sequence of numbers
But see, cause I aint gonna blunder
Im just typing code as fast as the thunder
I wrote all this code, look at git blame,
It’s history, like the blistering on these fingertips
